# Run Spider, RUN!
A short game for the N-Gage Jam 2024

Iâ€™m not proud of how it turned out. 
It was a fun exercise, but I overestimated my skills given the short time, and the result feels a bit messy.
If you want to check it out you can download the project source files and open them through Godot.
Feel free to do whatever you like with it!
